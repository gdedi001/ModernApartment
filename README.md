## Overview
Built a new apartment scene with nice lighting and custom animation. All the while, testing it on my Cardboard headset.
The goal was to design and create my own apartment based on several 3D models I was given. 
After laying out my scene then I was able deploy it to my phone to share it with friends and family.

## Skills utilized
* Adding 3D models to a scene
* Moving, scaling, and rotating 3D models
* Deploying to your Cardboard Viewer
* Creating materials and assigning textures
* Creating animations and triggering them
* Creating lights and baking them
* Optimizing a scene for top performance

## Time to Completion: 
Less than 1 day (about 15 hours)

## SDK
GoogleVR Unity SDK (v 1.0.3)

## Like: I enjoyed having the freedom to place the furniture and other 3D objects wherever I wanted. Prior to starting the project I drew out the floor plan on graph paper.

## Dislike: I wish I had a better understanding of how the teleporters worked.
